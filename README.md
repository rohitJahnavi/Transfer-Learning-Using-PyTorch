# Transfer-Learning-Using-PyTorch


# Overview
  * In this project, we utilize a pretrained VGG16 model to classify images using transfer learning. The following steps are implemented:

     * Setting Random Seeds for Reproducibility
     * Checking for GPU Availability
     * Data Preprocessing and Transformations
     * Model Loading (Pretrained VGG16)
     * Training and Evaluation Loop
     * Model Evaluation on Test and Training Data
